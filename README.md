# D-Dos
This repository offers a comprehensive Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack simulation, implemented in Python and leveraging common networking utilities. Its primary goal is to demystify the mechanics behind volumetric flooding attacks and illustrate their impact on service availability.
# DDoS Attack Simulation by Anmath Raj

This repository demonstrates a **Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack** simulation built using Python and various networking tools. The project aims to **understand** the mechanics of DDoS attacks and how they affect system availability. It provides a controlled environment for educational purposes and research, showcasing methods used to **perform** and **mitigate** such attacks.

## Key Features
- Simulates **traffic flooding** to a target system or network  
- Demonstrates **common techniques** used in DDoS attacks  
- Educational tool for learning about **network security**
